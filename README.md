# Parallel Linear Assignment Sorting (PLAS)
Sorting multi-dimensional data into locally smooth 2D grids.

The algorithm will sort tensors of shape *(C, n, n)*. It reorders the elements along the last two dimensions (grid columns and rows) with the attempt to minimize the $L^2$-distance between neighboring elements in $x$ and $y$ direction.

This method was developed for [Compact 3D Scene Representation via Self-Organizing Gaussian Grids](https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/Self-Organizing-Gaussians).


### Example

We can use PLAS to sort the pixels of an image, where *C=3* from the three color channels of the image. An example implementation can be found in `examples/sort_rgb_img.py`.

*Starry Night* by Vincent van Gogh             |  *Sorted Night* with PLAS
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![A reproduction of the painting Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh](/img/VanGogh-starry_night.jpg)  | ![All pixels of the painting sorted with the algorithm](/img/VanGogh-starry_night_sorted.png)

The sorted output contains the same pixels as the input image, reordered to have high similarity between neighbors.


### Install

Create a virtual environment with Python 3.10 and install PyTorch with your intended compute platform (https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/). Then:

```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/fraunhoferhhi/PLAS.git
```

### Usage

```Python
import plas

plas.sort_with_plas(...)
```

There is no documentation yet. Have a look at the `examples/` sources for parameters and return values usage.

#### Sort the Starry Night example image from the repo:
```bash
python examples/sort_rgb_img.py --img-path img/VanGogh-starry_night.jpg
```

#### Sort a 3DGS point_cloud.ply file:

Sort the Gaussians of a trained 3DGS scene (none provided in the repo):

```bash
python examples/sort_3d_gaussians.py --input-gs-ply /data/iteration_30000/point_cloud.ply \
       --output-gs-ply point_cloud_sorted.ply
```

#### Compare PLAS and FLAS on a random RBG grid

```bash
python eval/compare_plas_flas.py
```

Random grid of RGB colors |  Sorted with PLAS | Sorted with FLAS|
:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:|:-------------------------:
![256x256 random RGB colors](/img/random_rgb_grid.png)  | ![Sorted 256x256 random RGB colors with PLAS](/img/grid_PLAS.png) | ![Sorted 256x256 random RGB colors with FLAS](/img/grid_FLAS.png) |



#### Run PLAS on grids of different sizes and measure runtime

Evaluates the runtime of PLAS over the side length of the 2D grid. Uses 3 layers for the grids.

```bash
python eval/eval_plas_runtime_over_size.py
```

These values were measured with an *NVidia RTX 4090*:

#### Run PLAS with different improvement breaks and measure VAD

Evaluates the behavior of PLAS under different break thresholds. Decreasing the relative L2 threshold trades off additional sorting quality for longer runtime.

```bash
python eval/eval_plas_vad_over_break.py
```

These values were measured with an *NVidia RTX 4090* on a random `512x512x3` grid:

### Preparing data

Currently only square grids are supported in the implementation. Data needs to be truncated and reshaped into shape *(C, n, n)* before being passed into the sorting method.

If the input data is already partially ordered, you may consider shuffling it before calling PLAS, to avoid getting stuck in local minima. But given the iterative nature of the algorithm, a random shuffle will also increase the time to sort significantly.
